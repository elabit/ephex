# ephex - Ephemeral statistics exporter
*WIP - Work in progress*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elabit/ephex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elabit/ephex)

Prometheus exporter for Docker ephemeral storage statistics 

## What it does

This exporter provides metrics about the usage of ephemeral storage on each node in the Kubernetes cluster. Under certain circumstances, ephemeral storage cannot be cleaned up, which leads to unexpected results.

## Deployment 

The `manifests` folder contains all files to deploy ephex into a Kubernetes/Openshift cluster. 

Before deploying, plese replace the Helm variables `{{ .Values.namespace }}` by the namespace ephex should be running in. 

Then: 
```
cd manifests
for f in *.yaml; do oc apply -f $f; done
```
